💬 React Dictionary Chatbot

📘 Project Overview

-> The React Dictionary Chatbot is an interactive web application built using React.js.
This chatbot allows users to enter any English word, fetches its meaning from the free Dictionary API, and displays it in a clean chat interface.

-> It simulates a conversation between the user and a bot, where the bot responds with the definition of the entered word.
This project demonstrates the integration of APIs, React component-based architecture, and real-time UI updates.

🚀 Features

-> 💬 Chat-style interface between user and bot

-> ⌨️ Enter key support for faster interaction

-> ⚡ Real-time updates using React state management

-> 🎨 Clean and responsive UI with simple CSS styling

-> 🛠️ Technologies Used

-> React.js – Frontend framework for building the UI

-> JavaScript (ES6+) – Core language for logic and API integration
